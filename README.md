# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection-Model-using-CNN
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect driver drowsiness in real-time. By analyzing facial images, the model accurately identifies signs of fatigue and triggers alerts to prevent accidents. Key features include real-time monitoring via webcam and an integrated alert system.
